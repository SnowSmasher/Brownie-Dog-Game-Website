           <h2>Term 2 Week 7 and 8 (Planning Stage)</h2> <p>- During these two weeks we focused mainly on planning, this included brainstorming ideas, drawing up storyboards for both the game and the website and also setting up Github which was vital for the team to work together.</p> 
           
           <h2>Term 2 Week 9 and 10 (Asset Creation)</h2> <p>- Weeks 9 and 10 consists of the whole team creating necessary assets for either the game or the website, this included, for the game, sprites, BG music, map stages. Website assets included things like advertisements.</p>
           
           <h2>Term 3 Weeks 1 to 4 including the 2 weeks break (Production)</h2><p>- These 6 weeks was where the heavy lifting of the project started. During the 6 weeks our team worked hard to put together all the previously made assets into a game that met our standards, the creation of the website also took place in this time.</p>
           
           <h2>Term 3 Weeks 5 and 6 (Finalisation)</h2><p>- In the final two weeks finishing touches were added with everything being checked to make sure everything was working as planned.</p>
